WIKI_DEINO_DESC,"With a name meaning “Terrible Galerix”, [i]Deinogalerix[/i] is a gymnure, a cousin of hedgehogs with no quills. About 60 cm long, its long jaws and sharp teeth are perfectly adapted to eat small prey. It was only found on Gargano Island during the late Miocene.","With a name meaning “Terrible Galerix”, [i]Deinogalerix[/i] is a gymnure, a cousin of hedgehogs with no quills.

WIKI_GARGANO_DESC,"[i]Garganornis[/i] (“Gargano bird”) was a large Anatidae (the family of swans, geese and ducks). Thicker leg bones and short and robust wings suggest that it was flightless. This lifestyle was likely the result of its size increase, which acted as a deterrent to predators. Its estimated weight ranged between 15 and 22 kilograms, larger than any living Anatidae.","[i]Garganornis[/i] (“Gargano bird”) was a large Anatidae (the family of swans, geese and ducks).

WIKI_HOPLI_DESC,"Also known as prongdeer, Hoplitomeryx is an extinct ruminant endemic to Gargano Island. It is famous for its five horns, as well as protruding canines reminiscent of the extant musk deer. They showed a huge diversity of sizes and morphologies: it could be explained by the lack of predators on the island, with the exception of the giant owl Tyto.","Also known as prongdeer, Hoplitomeryx is an extinct ruminant endemic to Gargano Island.
